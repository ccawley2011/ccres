v1.14 ?? ??? 2007
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- More source code cleanup.
- When size of a template string exactly matches the given string length +
  its terminating character, '*' is outputed as length instead of the size
  value.
- Added sanity checks that binary text offsets are reasonable and do not
  overflow the text pool (both templates as for resources).

v1.13 03 Jun 2007
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Simplified source code a bit by removing the pointer typedefs.
- Convert.c(window_count): maximum of icons per windows was wrongly calculated
  which could result in memory corruption.
- Added Unix based test queue comparing result bin2txt with v1.11 reference
  and with an additional txt2bin + bin2txt result.
- IconIndirectTextAndSpriteObjectList(text_and_sprite.text): had missing
  column.  Bug reported by David Thomas <dave@davespace.co.uk>.
  After this fix the text to template conversion can give the error
  "Line 27: Missing entry 'text_and_sprite.text:'" which can be avoided and
  fixed by adding the missing column after "text_and_sprite.text" in your
  template text.
- IconIndirectTextObjectList, IconIndirectSpriteObjectList,
  IconIndirectTextAndSpriteObjectList: link the .size entry with the allocated
  sprite/text buffer.
  _Object(put_tstring): allocate always the size given in the limit entry when
  given and make sure the string in it is '\r' char terminated.  Also added
  warning when the limit is smaller than given sprite/text string.
  Bug reported by David Thomas <dave@davespace.co.uk>.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Support for cross-compilation using GCCSDK.
