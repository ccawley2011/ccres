A couple of notes for the CCRes developer or product builder:

- Building CCRes can currently only happen via cross-compilation using GCCSDK
  (3.4.6 or upcoming 4) or using a native compiler on a Unix alike host.  Also
  the OSLib headers need to be available at $GCCSDK_INSTALL_ENV.
  Supported platforms can have 32-bit or 64-bit pointers.  For supporting
  the latter ones, a copy of set of OSLib headers is taken during a non
  cross-compile build and the pointer type in the copy of the OSLib headers
  gets changed into a 32-bit int type.
  The pointer -> int type change is a hack and it might be that more is needed
  for platforms with have other alignment or size of builtin types different
  than the ARM ABI.
- Be sure to run the testqueue after each change in order to detect regression
  problems.  It would also be good practise to have as many bug fixes as
  possible covered by additional test cases.
