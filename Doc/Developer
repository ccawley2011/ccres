A couple of notes for the CCRes developer or product builder:

- Building CCRes can currently only happen via cross-compilation using GCCSDK
  (3.4.6 or upcoming 4) or using a native compiler on a Unix alike host.  Also
  the OSLib headers need to be available at $GCCSDK_INSTALL_ENV.
  Supported platforms can have 32-bit or 64-bit pointers.  For supporting
  the latter ones, a copy of set of OSLib headers is taken during a non
  cross-compile build and the pointer type in the copy of the OSLib headers
  gets changed into a 32-bit int type.
